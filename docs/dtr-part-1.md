- Decisions by consensus or, when there's disagreement, whoever feels the strongest about the issue

- When working independently, make sure all group members know what you're working on to avoid duplicating efforts

### Workload Expectations
- All group members understanding and feeling comfortable before moving on to the next iteration
- MVP is priority, but go above and beyond if time allows

### Workflow Expectations
- Use unit testing (and pseudocoding if necessary) to outline and document work
- Use atomic commits while ensuring everyone is close in their number of commits
- Name branches `feature/`, `refactor/` or `fix/` and name or description of iteration in kebab casing
- Use PR template
- Team members conduct a code review for each PR. Default to following, unless pair-programming:
  - Tony <-> Joshua
  - Anthony <-> Anna
- Reviewer will fetch and review code locally before approving the merge

- Take breaks as a team, unless in flow state

### Feedback Expectations
- Feedback in real-time preferrably
- At least at DTR check-in (Tuesday 8/31)

### Productive Work
- Use pomodoro to take regular breaks and stay fresh
- Use test suite/pseudocode to keep track of tasks and direction
- Anyone can ask the group to pause and reconsider the necessity of the current task or the time being spent on it
- If stuck for a whole pom, we will reach out for help
- Feel free to call out if group is getting off task or mission creepin'
- Ask for help earlier rather than later
