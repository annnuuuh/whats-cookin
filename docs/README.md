## Abstract
This project is designed to allow the user to search through a repository of recipes. The user should be able to select recipes as one of their favorites
as well as select recipes to cook that week. After clicking on the favorites tab you should be able to see every recipe you've denoted as your favorite, and
you should be able to filter them by their tags, or search keywords to pull up the most relevant ones. You can also search the entire repository by using keywords,
and from there you can further filter your results with the relevant tags that populate below the nav bar.
