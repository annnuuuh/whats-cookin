## Abstract
This project allows the user to search through a repository of recipes. The user may favorite recipes or add them to a list of recipes to cook, which may be viewed on the Favorites and Recipes to Cook pages, respectively. There, the user may filter the recipes by tag or searched by keyword. The user may also search the entire repository using keywords, and then further filter the results by tag.
